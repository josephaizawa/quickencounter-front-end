# QuickEncounter

## Overview

QuickEncounter is a web app designed for Dungeon Masters (DMs) to swiftly create challenging encounters by inputting party details and selecting monsters. This addresses the time-consuming nature of encounter preparation in tabletop role-playing games. The app focuses on calculating the correct difficulty for the party and allows for customization with the monster encounter selection.

### Problem

DMs need this app because prepping encounters can take hours. Existing apps often fall short by not providing an efficient way to match encounters to the partyâ€™s strength, making encounters either too easy or too difficult. QuickEncounter addresses these issues by offering a quick and efficient way to create diverse and challenging encounters, including the ability to select level appropriate suggested monster.

### User Profile

Both new and experienced DMs will use QuickEncounter. New DMs will get the help they need to create level-appropriate encounters, while experienced DMs can use it to quickly create encounters on the fly, making their campaigns feel more dynamic.

- **New DMs**: To create balanced and level-appropriate encounters with ease, reducing prep time and ensuring an enjoyable experience for their players.
- **Experienced DMs**: To quickly generate encounters during gameplay, keeping the campaign engaging and varied.

### Features

- **Party Information Input**: DMs can input the number of party members and their levels.
- **Encounter Generation**: Automatically generate a list of appropriately challenging monsters based on party information.
- **Monster Selection**: DMs can select level appropriate monsters from generated lists.

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React for web application development.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic.
- **Traditional API Calls**: For data fetching and operations.
- **APIs**:
  - [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/)
  - [Open5e API](https://api.open5e.com/)
  - [Magic The Gathering API](https://api.magicthegathering.io)

### APIs

- **Monster Data from APIs**: Initial monster data, including base stats, descriptions, and images, will be pulled from external APIs such as the D&D 5e API and Open5e API.

### Sitemap

The app will be a single-page application (SPA) with the following flow:

1.  **Party Composition Input**: DMs can input the party member names and their levels.
2.  **Encounter Type Selection**: DMs can select a starting encounter type based on party composition (Boss & Minions, Swarm, One Monster).
3.  **Monsters Suggestion**: Randomly suggest monsters to create the encounter.
4.  **Monster List and Stat Blocks**: Display a list of selected monsters and their stat blocks once the appropriate challenge rating is met for in-game use.
